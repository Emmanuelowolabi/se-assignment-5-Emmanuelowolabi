3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

   An Editor Group occurs when you split an editor via the Split Editor or Open to the Side command. This allows you to see things open in multiple editors at once.
   The Status Bar provides information about the open project and the files being edited.

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.

   The Command Palete gives access to all the functionality within VS Code. You can access this Palete in Windows by using "Ctrl+Shift+P".
   Some of the tasks you can perform using the Command Palette include cycling through the last set of files opened, you can also use it to go directly to the editor commands. Other things you can do with the Command Palette include navigating to specific lines in your files, navigating to specific symbols in files, and others.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

   Extensions in VS Code allow you to get various tools to support your development workflow. Those tools include languages, debuggers, and git tools.
   You can find and install extensions by clicking on the extensions icon in the VS Code sidebar. You can also manage installed extensions by clicking on them inside the extensions tab in the sidebar.
   Examples of essential extensions for web development include Intellisense, GitHub, your language such as Python.

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?

   You can find the integrated terminal in the activity bar in VS Code. You can click on it and decide to open a new terminal and run tasks. One major advantage of the integrated terminal is that you don't need to leave your IDE and go to the inbuilt terminal before you can run your tasks.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?

   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   VS Code has a built-in debugger for JavaScript and any language that is transpiled into JavaScript. However, if you're working with other languages, you need to install debugger extensions.

    To integrate Git with VS Code, you need to first install Git on your computer. Afterwards, you can initialize a repository in your chosen folder in "View>Source Control (SCM)" wherein you will find "main" as the default branch.
    To make commits, you have to save any changes you make to the file, and afterwards, you can commit your file by clicking on the commit button in the git section of the sidebar in your VS Code. This helps you push your changes to GitHub.
